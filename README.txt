Steps:

1. Unencrypt the weapons folder (gotta do that outside this bot) found in aces.vromfs.bin
	I recommend using a batch file to run the unencrypter over all files.
	The files should have extensions ".blkx"
2. Run Initialization.ts
3. Once you have VISUAL confirmation that Initialization.ts is finished, run hitpowerProc.ts
4. Ditto above but for hitpowerProc.ts, run Main.ts

Why am I making you run these files in sequence manually?
Because I have no fucking clue how to code.
